#+Title: Reaction diffusion G++

This is a 2D reaction-diffusion simulation by Mirco "MacSlow" MÃ¼ller
<macslow@gmail.com>

I rebuilt this on Emacs 25.3 (9.0) and g++ c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM
version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin17.2.0
(High Sierra)

To build reaction-diffusion from scratch follow the below instructions 

First clone the below repo with HTTPS or SSH.

- HTTPS
https://github.com/MacSlow/reaction-diffusion.git

- SSH
git@github.com:MacSlow/reaction-diffusion.git

- Requirements

To run the programm you'll first need to install the below dependencies.

 * cmake 2.8.12
 * nasm 2.11.08
 * C++-14 compiler (e.g. g++, clang++)
 * SDL 2.0.5

*cmake* is a software for managing the build process of software using
a compiler-independent method.

*SDL* Simple DirectMedia Layer is a software development library
designed to provide a hardware abstraction layer for computer
multimedia hardware components.

*nasm* the Netwide Assembler is an assembler and disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture. 

- Installation 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install nasm
$ brew install sdl
#+END_SRC

After you've installed those dependencies open terminal and =cd= to
the folder named "reaction-diffusion"

and type  =cmake .=

Then type =make=

You can execute the programm now.
